# CashCat

## Inspiration

Our journey with CashCat began with our friend's cat, Ozzy, and our shared desire to grow our finances over time. We recognized that traditional budgeting can feel tedious and disconnected from daily life. By turning financial management into an engaging experience with a pet companion, we set out to revolutionize how people interact with their money and make saving both meaningful and enjoyable.

## What It Does

CashCat helps users take control of their financial lives through four key features:

- **Expense tracking** that keeps users accountable by monitoring spending and setting weekly goals.
- **Visual breakdowns** of spending patterns through intuitive charts and graphs, making financial data accessible and understandable.
- **Financial literacy development** through Ozzy AI, which offers personalized guidance and educational content.
- **A social feature** that allows users to share their financial wins and purchases with friends and family, creating a supportive community.

When users stay within budget, Ozzy stays happy and celebrates their success. If they overspend, Ozzy gently nudges them back on track, turning financial discipline into a rewarding game rather than a chore.

## How We Built It

We developed CashCat using a comprehensive tech stack focused on creating a responsive, user-friendly experience. Our system design prioritizes secure integration with banking APIs like **Nessie** for accessing financial data. We implemented **ChartJS** for creating dynamic visualizations of spending patterns and built a clean, reactive UI that adapts seamlessly across devices. Our database design supports both personal financial tracking and social sharing features while maintaining strict privacy controls.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Throughout development, we encountered several significant hurdles:

- Creating a fully responsive design that works well across all devices.
- Implementing the social feature while maintaining privacy and security.
- Populating and integrating with the **Nessie API** for financial data.
- Learning and implementing **ChartJS** to create meaningful financial visualizations.
- Designing a clean, intuitive UI that remains engaging without becoming distracting.
- Balancing the playful pet companion aspect with serious financial management tools.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

Our team takes particular pride in several aspects of CashCat:

- The polished, intuitive user interface that makes financial management approachable.
- Our innovative **Ozzy AI** companion that provides personalized guidance and motivation.
- The seamless integration of serious financial tools with engaging gamification elements.
- The social sharing feature that encourages financial wellness through community support.
- Creating meaningful visualizations that help users understand their spending habits at a glance.
- Building a platform that genuinely helps improve financial literacy and habits.

## What We Learned

This project taught us valuable lessons about integrating complex financial systems with engaging user experiences. We discovered the importance of making data visualization both informative and accessible to users with varying levels of financial knowledge. Our team gained technical expertise in **reactive UI development, API integration, and database design**, while also developing a deeper understanding of how emotional connections (like a virtual pet) can motivate positive financial behaviors.

## What's Next for CashCat

Looking ahead, our roadmap includes several exciting developments:

- **Integrating with more banks** to provide users with a complete view of their finances.
- **Advancing the social feature** to include tagging people, uploading images and charts, and location tagging for purchases.
- **Creating a dedicated mobile app** so users can check their finances on the go.
- **Developing a more interactive virtual pet Ozzy** to further gamify the experience with contextualized motivation and reminders.
- **Expanding the financial literacy content** to address more complex topics and life stages.
- **Refining our personalized insights** to help users make even better financial decisions.

These enhancements will further our mission of making financial management engaging, educational, and effective for everyone.

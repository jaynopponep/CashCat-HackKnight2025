### Setting up your backend env
1. Make sure you have your `.env` file
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the flask server!
- `flask --app app:app run`</br>
or</br>
- `flask run`

For some reason, it is either one of these sometimes when newly setting it up, despite having the right environment variables. If you're able to figure this out lmk :)
